    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2 class="first-header">First part of my life</h2>
    <p>
      I believe I have quite an interesting background especially when talking about where I’m from.
      I always have a tough time answer the question, “Where are you from?” The reason being, I was
      born in India where I spent maybe the first two years of my life, then moved and grew up in
      Thailand. I stayed there for a good 15 years, as my father got a job there. However, in spite
      of being there so long, I was not considered a citizen due to visa conflicts. I attended one
      school for 13 years, Ekamai International School. It was where I went for elementary, middle,
      and high school. The curriculum was american-based and so I had a good exposure to learning
      English and how the education system worked. Thirteen years in the same school gifted me with
      some life long friends whom I still keep in touch with, though I’m on the other side of the
      world now. It was absolutely amazing growing up in such a beautiful country filled with really
      humble people. I’m quite certain it’s because of how others were, that I’ve grown to be who I
      am today, somewhat humble. After having spent so much time in Bangkok, it was time for
      graduation and I had to make the decision of whether to stay and continue my education or to
      leave to another country. The decision was nerve-wracking! Leaving parents, not having a
      constant money supply, living on my own in a new country, and dealing with so many new things
      was a scary thought. Nonetheless, I’m glad I made the right decision and decided to pursue a
      mechanical engineering degree in the States.
    </p>
    <h2>COD Life</h2>
    <p>
      “Wow! This is just like the movies!” is how I reacted to everything I saw when I stepped onto
      US soil. I was situated in the Chicago Suburbs, Glen Ellyn, where I attended college at the
      College of DuPage. I will forever be grateful to how amazing COD is and will always
      recommended it to anyone looking to obtain education for a cheaper price than universities.
      The campus is B-E-A-utiful! I had classes with some of the best professors of the college and
      was extremely satisfied for the education I received. As an international student, I had to
      rent out an apartment close to the college before flying into the States. As it was the first
      time, it was obviously scary for a 17 year old to figure out how to deal with the apartment
      lease, but things worked out as they always do. I remember the first year here was maybe one
      of the most adventurous years of my life. I had to find ways to buy groceries without a car,
      study at home without a table, sleep on an air mattress (didn’t want to buy a bed), cook, and
      basically manage everything in my life. It wasn’t tough, but rather quite fun to have so many
      new things to deal with. There certainly were times where it felt lonely to be in a country so
      far from where my parents were, but I always found ways to deal with it. I learned how to
      handle my emotions like stress, sadness, loneliness, and happiness. I spent a good three years
      at COD, where I met some amazing people whom I wish I was still in contact with. The amazing
      folks welcomed and taught me a lot about how things worked here. Life was great, but time
      caught on and I had to continue moving forward. COD was not a 4-year institution and therefore
      didn’t hand out bachelor degrees but only associates. When I was done with my Associates in
      Mechanical Engineering at COD, I decided to transfer to Illinois Institute of Technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s been my second year at IIT and I’m a graduating senior this coming May (2020)! For the
      longest time, I was contemplating whether I should pursue a master’s degree but just before
      the deadline, I decided I was done studying and wanted to gain industry experience. Maybe if I
      took four years instead of five years to complete my bachelors, I would have gone ahead with
      getting a master’s degree, but that wasn’t the case so I decided otherwise. A Bachelor’s in
      Mechanical Engineering at IIT has been a different experience than what I went through at COD.
      Undoubtedly, a 4 year institution doesn’t have small classes like a community college
      typically does, the community is different, and so is the student - teacher connection.
      Nonetheless, I’ve enjoyed my experience here and am glad I had the chance to learn some pretty
      cool things in the Mechanical Engineering courses I’ve taken. So far, this last semester has
      been my favorite as I’ve signed up for courses that I’m very much interested in addition to
      the required courses needed to obtain my degree. I have a good load of 7 courses this semester
      and would have signed up for more if I could, but time is limited and priorities are
      important. One of my favorite classes I have really been looking forward to is COM 330 with
      Professor Stolley. I’ve always had a thing for coding in different languages, but haven’t
      quite got the grasp of web-development as much as others. When looking through the list of
      Humanities courses, I was certain I wanted to enroll in COM 330 as it was being offered and I
      don’t see who shouldn’t take the course. Nearly everyone loves talking about themselves and so
      why not make a portfolio of the amazing things you’ve done and post it online for others to
      learn from. Just a year ago, I had started building my own website in WordPress, filling it
      with some of my content and decorating it a bit. However, once classes started last semester I
      stopped working on it, but this semester I’ve been really  happy to have a course dedicated to
      working on my site. By the end of this course, I hope to be able to design and maintain my own
      website on my very own domain.
    </p>
    <h2>Job Search</h2>
    <p>
      The hardest part of this semester is job searching while doing my best in the last batch of
      classes. Job searching as an international student is not easy at all. Unlike locals, we have
      the pressure of being kicked out of the country if employment is not guaranteed within a
      certain amount of time. Finding a company that’s willing to sponsor a work-visa and
      furthermore a green card in the future is a painstaking process, but there are ways to go
      about it. I’ve learned a whole lot about the process and am still in pursuit of a full-time
      position. I’ve hears stories of how people apply to 500+ companies and maybe get a reply from
      1 or 2 - how depressing. I honestly, don’t have the time and can’t be bothered to write out
      500 cover letters and resumes for each application and so I’ve been trying out a different
      approach. I’m certain that getting a referral holds a lot more weight than a resume in a stack
      of 300 other candidates. Therefore, I try to reach out to people in the field of my interest
      and build rapport. Building rapport can lead to a referral and from there, a position of your
      choosing. It’s a pity, but also a blessing that not everyone goes through the experience of
      living independently in a new country and figuring out life as it comes.
